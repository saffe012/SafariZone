# Safari Zone
A program written in Python that emulates the Safari Zone from Pokemon with a simple GUI.

## Prerequisites

A Python compiler is necessary to execute this program.

## Usage

The goal of this game is to catch as many Pokemon, or catch the Pokemon you desire through the use of rocks (to make the Pokemon easier to catch but more likely to flee), the use of bait (to make the Pokemon less likely to flee but harder to catch), and Pokeballs (when a user wants to attempt to catch the Pokemon). A user can also skip a Pokemon if they'd like to find a more desirable monster. 

A user has 30 Pokeballs to use before the game ends. There over 150 different Pokemon in the game to discover.

Upon start-up of this program, the user will immediately be presented with a photo of a randomly chosen Pokemon on screen with 4 buttons: throw bait, throw rock, throw Pokeball, or run away. The user can then use these buttons to manipulate the game to their liking. 

If the user runs away a new Pokemon will be displayed on screen. If a Pokeball is thrown, one of three things will happen: the Pokemon will run away, the Pokemon will be captured, or the Pokeball will have no effect. If bait or a rock is thrown one of two things will happen: the Pokemon will run away, or the Pokemons stats may change (unseen by user). If the Pokemon ever runs away a new Pokemon will appear on the screen.

Once the user exhausts all 30 of their Pokeballs, the user will be presented with a list of all the Pokemon they caught during the game.
